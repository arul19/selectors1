        <p id=photo> In physics the term 'light' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength,<br>
            whether visible or not.In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light.<br>
            Like all types of electromagnetic radiation,<br> 
            visible light propagates as waves. However,<br>
            the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed.<br>
            The absorbed energy of the electromagnetic waves is called a photon and represents the quanta of light.<br>
             When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon,<br>
            the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location and this location is where the photon "arrives".<br>
            This is what is called the wave function collapse.<br>
            This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the waveâ€“particle duality.<br>
             The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.<br>
